# Hello Bluetooth

This is a simple swift app that demonstrates very basic bi-directional communicate with an Arduino via bluetooth. It is designed to work out-of-thebox with an Arduino 101 running the `ButtonLED` example project.

## Setup

Simply connect a push button to pin 4 on your Arduino 101 an upload the `ButtonLED` sketch to it. While the Arduino is running, launch the `HelloBluetooth` iOS app on a device. You can then play with the push button or the button in the iOS app.
